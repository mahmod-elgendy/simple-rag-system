Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed for every detail. Instead of following rigid, predefined instructions, ML models identify patterns, make predictions, or uncover insights by analyzing large amounts of information. You can think of it as teaching a computer to recognize complex relationships within data, much like how ChatGPT learns from vast amounts of text to generate responses.
Imagine a world where machines don't just process information but evolve with it. This is the promise of Machine Learning — a transformative approach where algorithms continuously refine themselves, turning raw data into intelligent action and opening doors to innovations that can adapt to our ever-changing needs.
